# Note for the users

- I created this website to see how Django works and how the database works in django. 
- Now i want you to upgrade it, as per your creativity and own ideas.
- The pages like register code, sharing note may crash because they work on email service.  So before running the project kindly give the credentials of your gmail account in settings(at last emailId & Password).
- I recommend you to create a dummy gmail account for this project.
- In start the code will seems to be bit complex to understand but i know you will get it.
- I also recommend you to please work your own branch and test it before merging.
